#Current issues.
This is where I am going to list any problems I run into while coding and can't seem to figure out on my own.

## Issue with MIME in ES6?
When I try to preview the game in the browser I get this error:

``Failed to load module script: The server responded with a non-JavaScript MIME type of "text/html". Strict MIME type checking is enforced for module scripts per HTML spec.``

I tried to mess with the index.html file, but I think I broke something.

Other than that, let me know what you think of the more modular code.
